This is my fixed version of the [save_breaker] alpha's campaign (for version ***[v 2.0.16]***),
where I fixed the level test logic for the `Symphony` architecture creation levels (as much as it was possible).

To install this, simply open your `[game install location]\campaign` folder,
delete or move out all of it's contents apart from file `.DS_store` & then copy
the contents of this repository (apart from `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore` & `RADME.md` files)
into that folder.

It is advised that you do this when the game isn't running.
